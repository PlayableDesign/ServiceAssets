Unity ScriptableObject Services 

This project (Unity 2021.3 LTS) contains an example of using ScriptableObject assets as services that are provided to a MonoBehaviour. Each service encapsulates a single responsibility, is stateless and is configurable as an asset (can be interchanged, tested, etc).
